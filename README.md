# HitBallGame

Author: John Lee
Made in high school, in 2016

This repository contains a game that resembles Dance Dance Revolution.
In the HitBallGame package, the HitBallGame.Java contains the main function
that will begin the game. Assuming JDK is installed, a window will pop as
soon as the main function called. The instructions on how to play the game
are all shown once the game window is opened.

There are two modes, pointGame and survivalGame. PointGame challenges the
player to 4 levels, and the objective is to hit as many balls as possible.
Combos will increase the number of points awarding for hitting the next ball.
SurvivalGame starts off easy, and there are more than a dozen levels that
increase in difficulty. Combos will award more "lives," so in the beginning,
players can stack up lives with easy combos, but as the game progresses,
getting combos becomes very difficult and lives will be lossed as the player
inevitably misses the balls coming down from 6 lanes.

Good luck playing!
